## Why another React select library
There are many well built [React select libraries](https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components#select) in the wild. They all work well but with many of our projects we had a **requirement** no one was able to support: with medium and small touch devices (phones and pads) **the native select UI has to be shown instead of a custom one**. That's because the users are familiar with that UI and find it more easy to fill that form fields.
